<h2>Point on Line</h2>
<equation>
  \Transpose{\Vec{x}} \Vec{l} = 0
</equation>


<h2>Intersection of Lines</h2>
<equation>
\begin{aligned}
  \Vec{l} (\Vec{l} \times \Vec{l}') \Vec{l}' (\Vec{l} \times \Vec{l}') &= 0 \\
  \Transpose{\Vec{l}} \Vec{x} = \Transpose{\Vec{l}}' \Vec{x} &= 0 \\
  \Vec{x} &= \Vec{l} \times \Vec{l}'
\end{aligned}
</equation>

<h2>Plane</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A plane can be defined by the join between three points, or the join
  between a line and a point in general</li>
  <li>Two planes intersecting a unique line</li>
  <li>Three planes intersecting a unique point</li>
</ul>

<h2>Three Points Define a Plane</h2>

<p>Suppose you have three points $\Vec{p}_{1}$, $\Vec{p}_{2}$, $\Vec{p}_{3}$,
and are incident with a plane, $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ then each point satisfies
<equation>
  \Transpose{\boldsymbol{\pi}} \Vec{p}_{i} = 0.
</equation>
By stacking each point as a matrix
<equation>
\begin{aligned}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \Transpose{\Vec{p}_{1}} \\
    \Transpose{\Vec{p}_{2}} \\
    \Transpose{\Vec{p}_{3}}
  \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\pi} = 0
\end{aligned}
</equation>
Since three points in general are rarely linearly independent, it follows that
the $3 \times 4$ matrix compsed of the points $\Vec{p}_{i}$ as rows has rank
3.</p>

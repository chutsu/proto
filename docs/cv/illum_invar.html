<h1>Illumination Invariant Transform</h1>

<p>Robust fast AprilTag detection emerged from experience with the standard
black and white AprilTag during outdoor experiments, where the detection
becomes unreliable in certain lighting conditions. In particular, detection
fails when strong shadows cover tag features fully or partially. The cause of
failure is due to how the detection process relies on image gradients to detect
the edges and lines of the tag in order to extract the relative tag pose.
Depending on the time of day or weather conditions, this can have a significant
impact on reliable AprilTag detection. This sensitivity to illumination was
addressed by using the illumination invariant transform by [Maddern2014].</p>

<p>The illumination invariant transform takes three input channels from the
image, and returns a single illumination adjusted channel, $I$, as follows,
<equation>
	I = \log(R_{2}) - \alpha \log(R_{1}) - (1 - \alpha) \log(R_{3})
</equation>
where $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ are sensor responses (or image channels)
corresponding to peak sensitivities at ordered wavelengths $\lambda_{1} <
\lambda_{2} < \lambda_{3}$, and $\alpha$ is determined by the following
equations,
<equation>
  \dfrac{1}{\lambda_{2}} &=
    \dfrac{\alpha}{\lambda_{1}}
    + \dfrac{\left(1 - \alpha \right)}{\lambda_{3}} \\
    \alpha &= \dfrac{\lambda_{1} (\lambda_{2} - \lambda_{3})}
    {\lambda_{2} (\lambda_{1} - \lambda_{3})}
</equation>
</p>

<p>This transform, however, has a non-intuitive effect on black and white
targets, as the three channels tend to be equally over and under exposed in RGB
images. As a result, the transform leads to similar values for white and black
pixels, eliminating the ability for the AprilTag library to detect edges. To
resolve this issue, we designed a new AprilTag so that the single channel image
produced by using the equation introduced above produces a grey scale like
image that is robust to shadows and changes in illumination. Examining
\eqref{eq:illlum_invar}, it can be observed the resulting pixel intensities are
maximized when the camera observes green ($R_{2}$) and minimized when viewing a
mixture of red and blue, ($R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$ respectively). The proposed
illumination invariant AprilTag shown in is created by replacing the white and
black portions of a typical AprilTag with green and magenta. This modification
was tested under various lighting conditions.
Fig.~\ref{fig:illum_invar_comparision} shows the tag's appearance after
performing the illumination invariant transform, creating a single channel
image that replaces the typical single channel, grey scale image that is
typically used by the AprilTag library. The images shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:illum_invar_comparision} are taken using a PointGrey Chameleon3
(CM3-U3-28S4C-CS) with a Sony ICX818 image sensor. The corresponding values of
$\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}, \lambda_{3}$ and $\alpha $ are 480 nm, 510 nm, 640 nm
and 0.56 respectively as noted in the sensor data sheets.</p>

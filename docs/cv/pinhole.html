<h1>Pinhole Camera Model</h1>

<p>The pinhole camera model describes how 3D scene points are projected onto
the 2D image plane of an ideal pinhole camera. The model makes the assumption
that light rays emitted from an object in the scene pass through the pinhole of
the camera, and projected onto the image plane.</p>

<p>A 3D point $\Vec{p}_{C} = [p_x \quad p_y \quad p_z]^{\transpose}$ expressed
in the camera frame, $\frame_{C}$, projected on to the camera's 2D image plane
$(u, v)$ is written as,
<equation>
  u = \dfrac{p_x f_{x}}{p_z} + c_x \quad v = \dfrac{p_y f_{y}}{p_z} + c_y
</equation>
where $f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$ denote the focal lengths, $c_{x}$ and $c_{y}$
represents the principal point offset in the $x$ and $y$ direction. Or, in
matrix form
<equation>
	\Vec{x}_{C} = \Mat{K} \Vec{p}_{C}
</equation>
<equation>
	\begin{bmatrix}
		u \\ v \\ 1
	\end{bmatrix} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		f_{x} & 0 & c_{x} \\
		0 & f_{x} & c_{y} \\
		0 & 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		p_x / p_z \\ p_y / p_z \\ 1
	\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
</p>

<p>In practice, the pinhole camera model only serves as an approximation to
modern cameras. The assumptions made in the model are often violated with
factors such as large camera apertures (pinhole size), distortion effects in
camera lenses, and other factors. That is why the pinhole camera model is often
used in combination with a distortion model in the hope of minimizing
projection errors from 3D to 2D. Common distortion models used in conjuction
with the pinhole camera model includes:</p>

  <li><a href="#cv-equi">Equi-distant distortion</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Guessing the focal length from the camera's field of view</h2>

Using basic trigonometry, if we know the len's field of views we can obtain the
focal length in the $x$ and/or $y$ direction.

<h1>Standard Deviation</h1>

The standard deviation $\sigma$ is defined as the square root of the variance
$\sigma^{2}$. It is also a measure of spread in the data. However standard
deviation is often more intuitive, because instead of the spread in terms of
distance from the \textit{mean squared}, the standard deviation is simply the
distance from the mean (not \textit{mean squared}).

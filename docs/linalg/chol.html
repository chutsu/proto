<h1>Cholesky Decomposition</h1>

<p>Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization is a decomposition of a
Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular
matrix and its conjugate transpose.
<equation>
  \Mat{A} = \Mat{L} \Mat{L}^{\ast}
</equation>
where $\Mat{L}$ is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal
entries, and $\Mat{L}^{\ast}$ is the conjugate transpose of $\Mat{L}$.

<h1>QR Decomposition</h1>

QR decomposition or QR factorization is a decomposition of a matrix
$\Mat{A}$ into a product,
<equation>
  \Mat{A} = \Mat{Q} \Mat{R}
</equation>
of an orthogonal matrix $\Mat{Q}$ and an upper triangular matrix
$\Mat{R}$. If $\Mat{A}$ is square and invertible, then the factorization is
unique if we require the diagonal elements of $\Mat{R}$ to be positive.

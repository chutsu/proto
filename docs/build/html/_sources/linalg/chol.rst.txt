Cholesky Decomposition
======================

Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization is a decomposition of a
Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular
matrix and its conjugate transpose.

.. math::

  \Mat{A} = \Mat{L} \Mat{L}^{\ast}

where :math:`\Mat{L}` is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive
diagonal entries, and :math:`\Mat{L}^{\ast}` is the conjugate transpose of
:math:`\Mat{L}`.

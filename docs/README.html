</code></pre>
<p>The commands you usually care about are <code>debug</code>, <code>release</code> and <code>install</code>.</p>
<p>Or, if you're old-fashioned the standard way to build a C++ project is to enter
the following commands at the root of the repo.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install  # By default will install to /usr/local
</code></pre>

dependencies and building of <code>prototype</code>, the make targets are as follows.</p>
<pre><code>deps:
  Install prototype dependencies.

debug:
  Build prototype in debug mode.

release:
  Build prototype in release mode.

install:
  Install prototype to $PREFIX. By default this is "/usr/local".

format_code:
  Format prototype code using clang-format.

docs:
  Generate docs for prototype.
</code></pre>
<p>The commands you usually care about are <code>debug</code>, <code>release</code> and <code>install</code>.</p>
<p>Or, if you're old-fashioned the standard way to build a C++ project is to enter
the following commands at the root of the repo.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install  # By default will install to /usr/local
</code></pre>

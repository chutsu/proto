<h1>Notations</h1>

<p>A large part of robotics is about developing machines that perceives and
interact with the environment. For that robots use sensors to collect and
process data, and knowing what the data describes is of important for the robot
to navigate and interact with the environment. The following notes will be
using the frame notation as described by Paul Furgale (see <a
href="https://tinyurl.com/y635m93l">link</a>). The aim is to mitigate the
ambiguity that arises when describing robot poses, sensor data and more.</p>

<p>A vector expressed in the world frame, $\frame_{W}$, is written as $\pos_{W}$.
Or more precisely if the vector describes the position of the camera frame,
$\frame_{C}$, expressed in $\frame_{W}$, the vector can be written as
$\pos_{WC}$. The left hand subscripts indicates the coordinate system the
vector is expressed in, while the right-hand subscripts indicate the start and
end points. For brevity if the vector has the same start point as the frame to
which it is expressed in, the same vector can be written as $\pos_{WC}$.
Similarly a transformation of a point from $\frame_{W}$ to $\frame_{C}$ can be
represented by a homogeneous transform matrix, $\tf_{WC}$, where its rotation
matrix component is written as $\rot_{WC}$ and the translation component
written as $\trans_{WC}$. A rotation matrix that is parametrized by quaternion
$\quat_{WC}$ is written as $\rot\{\quat_{WC}\}$.</p>

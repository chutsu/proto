<h1>Variance</h1>

<p>Variance is a measure of spread, it is the average squared distance between
measurements and the mean.</p>

<p>The <b>Population variance</b> is defined as,
<equation>
  \sigma^{2} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^{2}}{N}.
</equation>
and the <b>Sample variance</b> is defined as,
<equation>
  \sigma^{2} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^{2}}{n - 1}.
</equation>
Where $N$ is the population size and $n$ is the sample size.</p>

<p>In plain english, the population variance, standard deviation, etc, is when
the whole population data is available. Sample variance, standard deviation,
etc, on the other hand implies the availble data is only a subset of the
population.</p>

<p>The problem with sample data is that estimates without applying the $n - 1$
correction will often underestimate the true value. This is particularly true
if $n$ is small. By using $n - 1$ instead of $n$ as the divsor corrects the
estimate by making the result slightly larger.</p>

<p>The degrees of freedom is another perspective of why $n - 1$ should be use when
estimating from sample data. In statistics the degrees of freedom describe the
number variables that could affect the response or output of a model. (need
more explaining)</p>

<h1>First Estimate Jacobians (FEJ)</h1>

In the context of real time state-estimation, a fixed-lag smoother provides a
way to bound the optimization problem in order to operate in real time. The
method to remove old states in the state vector is called
<i>marginalization</i>. To perform marginalization the Schur's complement is
used to marginalize out old states.

Simply performing marginalization, however, introduces estimator
inconsistencies.

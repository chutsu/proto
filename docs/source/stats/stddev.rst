Standard Deviation
==================

The standard deviation :math:`\sigma` is defined as the square root of the
variance :math:`\sigma^{2}`. It is also a measure of spread in the data.
However standard deviation is often more intuitive, because instead of the
spread in terms of distance from the \textit{mean squared}, the standard
deviation is simply the distance from the mean (not *mean squared*).

.. math::

  \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}
